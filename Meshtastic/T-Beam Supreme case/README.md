My own backup of this great design from [TonyG](https://www.printables.com/model/616635-t-beam-supreme-case-for-meshtastic). Please buy his case and his model. This is just a backup of a modded version with:
Self tapping screws for the internal parts, full hex design in the front.

Used with [T-Beam supreme units](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dkckp0R).
