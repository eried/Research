# Description

There is a click sound on the passenger side when going over bumps, when the seat belt is not being used.

# Problem

The belt buckle attachment that goes to the lap pretensioner hook has some play.

# Solution

Remove the belt buckle using two screwdrivers (or the [1133787-00-A](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDoeBrb) key). Using [fabric tape](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_Dm5W0Qh), wrap around the hook and reasemble.

The idea is that the assembly is snug now, and if you move the belt buckle part, there is no play over the hook. Repeat for the other side if you want, just for symmetry.
