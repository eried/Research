# Problem

The frunk can be opened remotely, but it cannot be closed. Also, the frunk needs to be closed applying presure, leaving marks on the hood and possibly damaging it if done incorrectly.

# Solution

There are [few](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DllGyjL) [solutions](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DD6eJh7), I recommend the one that looks like this:

The "newer" solution that does not use the extra golden piece seen in the photo is simpler to install but, in my opinion, does not fit properly (the motor rubs against a part in the car) and it is noiser. The install procedure is simple, there is many videos about this but I wanted to add info about problem resolution and final alignment.

## Frunk does not fully close

There is a very narrow instance where the frunk can fully close. It seems very tricky at first. Do not attach the final lid (the one with the light) inside the frunk, loose the nuts of the latch system until it fully closes the frunk.

## Hood alignment

The center alignment should feel right first. Remember that the original alignment was not perfect, so there is no point of trying to get it perfectly align; it will be better than the factory alignment eitherway.

After the center feels "in line", adjust the rubber screws on each side of the hood. This might mess with the previous step, so be careful.

## Red battery cap does not fit

The cap of the LV battery presses the wire and does not close properly. This is not commented on the instructions, but I think it is good to know. Try to pass the cable through the middle part, slightly deforming the cap (if you dare, you can make a small cut on the lid), trying to not damage the wire.
