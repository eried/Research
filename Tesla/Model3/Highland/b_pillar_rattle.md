# Description

A creaking noise is present in the B-pillar area, sounds like plastic rubbing inside when you apply pressure.

# Problem

The upper plastic clips rub against the metal body of the pillar.

# Solution

Pull the weather strip from the rim around the window area

I tried several materials. The best result is with a thick [soft single side foam](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DC9H3Pj). Strangely not covering the whole tab works better. There is 3 tabs per side

It will look like this at the end, no more noise
