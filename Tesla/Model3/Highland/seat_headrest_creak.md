# Description

There is a creak when you apply pressure to the head rest. For example, replicate by holding the head rest and jiggle back and forth.

# Problem

The back seat cover shell has some hooks that interface with the seat and the head rest post that produce the sound.

# Solution

Remove the head rest, press the metal spring on each head rest post and pull. You do not need to fully remove the head rest, just enough to unlock the back seat shell.

Pull and you will see two hooks in the back. Do not pull it away that much, there are fragile clips on the bottom that you might damage.

Using a piece of [felt tape](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DDMhioD), wrap the plastic hook of the back seat cover like this:

Reassemble and enjoy.
