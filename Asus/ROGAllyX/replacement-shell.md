# Transparent shell for ROG Ally X

I dropped my Ally X while was on the "official" pouch/case and the left side broke in this way:

Original parts can be ordered from [Asus](https://en.accessoires-asus.com/rog-spare-parts/). The back part, shipping and (25%) taxes to Norway of the part was around 100 EUR, with fast shipping from France:

However, I also ordered this [alternative transparent replacement](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DEfhAff) from aliexpress for much lower price. It arrived few days later, after the original part. Let's check it out in detail.

## Comparing

Packaging on the original part was superb, sturdy box, thick bubble wrap. The alternative one was packaged OK, it included a screwdriver, 3 pairs of different M1 and M2 buttons and screws.

Another view of both. You can tell how the alternative replacement recreates the features of the original one, with minimal changes, which makes me think it was not a direct copy.

The screws on the alternative have a conical head, which I do not think it is the best for plastics. The M1 and M2 buttons have the text "M1" and "M2" embossed on the surface (you can feel it with your fingertips), instead of the original debossed ones. There is no padding to press against the battery (the original has 2 strips of 1 mm foam and 1 square pad of the same thickness)

## Conclusion

For the money, the alternative is impressive. It looks good, specially when the console is on and the light shines thru the back part.

They achieved almost 95% of what was required to be perfect. The fit of the alternative is a bit loose on the sides (it does not snap perfectly) and the top part is quite sharp to the touch. I would imagine this will require 1 or 2 more cycles of refinement. Personally I just used the original cover, which snaps firmly, as expected. I will add a [protection bumper](https://s.click.aliexpress.com/e/_DCq3Kyt) to prevent the issue of cracking the sides.
