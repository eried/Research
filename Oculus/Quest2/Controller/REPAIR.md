# Meta Quest 2 remote trigger sticks repair

The trigger in the Quest 2 remote might stick, making it not smooth at the beginning of the motion while pressing it. This is caused by the rubber bumpers sticking. 

## Disassembly

1. Remove battery lid, and the 4 screws inside the battery compartment and use an opening pick to remove the top cover which has some glue

4. Remove the piece around the grip trigger. This just separates easily from the bottom. It is in between two pieces on the top. Remove the piece around the main trigger too. For this piece you should bend the bottom until it snaps from the pin

5. To fix the issue, clean the rubber pads around the trigger. There are 3. Some alcohol will be ok. Also you can try to sand the rubber with some fine sanding paper (400-800 grit).

6. Furthermore, sand the inside plastic where those rubber pads make contact with the shell

7. Re-assemble. If you took appart the trigger button for cleaning the rubber pads, check that the spring leads are inside, making contact with the capacitive plate that detects the finger presence
